### Hi there 👋

Hi, I'm Vic and I like to build things.

I'm the Chief Technology Officer & Co-Founder of Food for All, the marketplace that connects individuals to tasty meals that otherwise wouldn’t have been sold, creating an extra revenue stream and eco-friendly branding for restaurants. Previously, I worked as a Lead Engineer at Driblet Labs, working on a Smart Water Management IoT solution to track and conserve water. 

Also alumni of some major startup accelerators:

[Techstars (2019)](https://www.techstars.com/newsroom/cooking-up-the-next-class-at-techstars-farm-to-fork)

[Urban-X (2019)](https://www.urban-x.com/company/food-for-all/)

[MassChallenge (2018)](https://masschallenge.org/startups?combine=food%20for%20all&industries=All%20industries&location=All%20locations&year=2018&status=any&startup=FoodforAll#eform)

👨🏻‍🎓I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Hardware Engineering 💻 with a minor in Robotics 🦾 from [Tec de Monterrey, Campus Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en/monterrey).
